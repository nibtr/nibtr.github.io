August 14th, 2023, the day is finally here, first day being an intern. I got super nervous the night before, to the point where I literally couldn't think of anything else. But in the end, it didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought.

## Some backstory

I applied to a few companies prior to this, but you guessed it, I failed. I mean, most of them were rejections on the CV round, but I did manage to land myself some interviews. I think I did well, though it was only for an internship so the questions and challenges weren't that difficult. I was able to answer most of them, but in my honest opinion, others were better than me.

Fast forward a bit, an HR dm'ed me on LinkedIn and asked me if I were interested in an internship program. The company I was about to work for is [DevSamurai](https://devsamurai.vn/), a software development consulting firm. At first I didn't notice the message at all, and only replied to her a week later (I'm sorry :<). She asked me if I was still interested, and I said yes. The following week, I had a technical interview with the seniors at the company, who would be in charge of training me during the internship.

They asked me a bunch of questions like my academic background, my familiarity with technology X and Y, etc., you know the usual stuff. They then gave me a coding challenge. It was a simple UnSplash clone and the deadline due was 1 week. I did manage to finish all of the requirements in around 2 days (no I'm not a genius), though I think I could've done better.

You can view the project [here](https://github.com/nhthieu/isplash). It's kinda limited in features and I don't think my code is that good (in other words, sucks).

## Making my way downtown

Driving fast, faces pass and I'm office bound.

I drove down some of the most busiest roads in Ho Chi Minh City. Yes, I'm talking about you Mr. Hoang Van Thu. It was like crazy congested, all lanes were completely filled with people honking nonstop. If i were to have a penny for everytime this road was congested, I would be a rich by now.

The company rented a small office in a building, and it was quite nice. I was greeted by the HR, and she gave me a tour around the office. The environment seemed casual and laid back, which helped calm my nerves. It's a small office, but I find it quite cozy.

I then met with the other interns, 2 more to be exact and we were told to be working together on the company's project. One of them studies at my school so we made friends pretty quickly. I heard that the company has quite a lot of interns, and most of them are from my school.

Then came a special "gift". The company provided us each with a brand new Macbook Air M1 2020 to work with. I was like "Dude, I'm getting paid and a Macbook?".

I was a bit surprised since I didn't think that they would give us a anything let alone a laptop from an overly expensive brand. I know it's not the greatest one out there (and I'm not a fan of Apple), but I'm not complaining on free stuff lol. And by the way, as you can see on the picture, I do bring my [waifu](https://bocchi-the-rock.fandom.com/wiki/Ryo_Yamada) with me to the office.

## Onboarding

Right off the bat, they gave me a list called "Onboarding Checklist", which contains all of the things that I need to do on my first day. Some of the important things are:

- Signing a NDA (Non-disclosure agreement).
- Fingerprint for the office.
- Vanta (a security tool) for the Macbook.
- Encryption the hard drive.
- Security and company policies.

They then gave me the company email, which I will be using to check for work-related stuff. Next, I was told to install some softwares, like Slack, Git, node, etc., and setup some of the Atlasian products. A special thing about the company is that they partnered with Atlassian, so we were given free access to all of their products. Some of the products that I use are Jira, Confluence and Bitbucket. I was told to create an Atlassian account and link it to my company email.

## The project

We had a meeting with Mr. T, our team leader. He gave us a brief introduction about the company's projects and what we will be working on. They have a lot of products, mainly add-ons for Jira and Confluence, and some other products like a custom server, a project management app, some other super-credential-that-an-intern-doesn't-have-access-to apps, etc.

I was assigned to work on a "poll" add-on, which is sort of like that on Facebook, but comes with different types of polls. He then gave us a list of conventions that the company adheres to, like the issues message conventions, commit message format, how they manage branches, the coding style, etc.

## Rest of the day

Since it was my first day so there wasn't a lot of tasks to work on. I was only assigned to some basic "Hello world" introduction to the Atlassian cloud environment, like setting up development environment, setting up tokens and stuff. They gave me the documentation and I was able to finish it pretty quickly.

As I went along the day, I did notice the people here were so focused on their work, keyboard clacking and screens filled with code, sometimes with a cup of coffee by their side. I could feel the "vibe" of the office, and I liked it. _(look forward to meeting other man of culture here)_

## Some thoughts

It didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought. I was nervous at first, but noticing that the people here are so friendly and welcoming, I felt more comfortable. Although driving more than 15km everyday is a bit tiring, but I think I can get used to it. Besides that, it's been a smooth ride so far. I'm looking forward to my days here, and hope I can learn a thing or two from the internship.
